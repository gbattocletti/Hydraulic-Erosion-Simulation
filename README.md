# Hydraulic-Erosion-Simulation

NOTE: this is a work in progress project. If you don't see any recent update, I probably (temporarily) switched to some other project. Check once in a while for updates.

The project is aimed to simulate the effect of hydraulic erosion on a randomly generated terrain. The result is a realistic-looking terrain, with mountain ranges and valleys. Inspiration was mainly taken from Sebastian Lague's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaXk97ujbPQ&t=86s. A more formal discussion of the topic can be found in Hans Theobald Beyer thesis (in the Papers directory).
